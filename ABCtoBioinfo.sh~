## I. Install Python3 locally
## 1. go to https://www.python.org/downloads/source/ and select a relatively new but not the newest release Gzipped source tarball
## 2. Save the tgz tarball on the server

```
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.7/Python-3.5.7.tgz ## change the version number accordingly
```

## 3. Locally install it. If you choose the latest version, and it prompts error messages that you eventually cannot solve it afer googling very hard. Try a relatively older but potentially more stable version.

```
cd /path/to/this/python/ ## go to the directory where you store the Python tarball
tar -zxvf Python-3.5.7.tgz ## unzip the tarball
mkdir /path/to/install/python3 ## create another new folder under the directory you like. This folder will be used to install Python3
cd Python-3.5.7 ## go in the unzipped Python tarball
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/python3 ## give the path where you want to install Python3
make
make install ## now you have successfully installed the Python3
```

## 4. Run python3 and pip. You can do it in two ways: a. cd /path/to/install/python3/bin/ and run ./python3 ./pip3; b. export the path to the environmental variable $PATH by ```export PATH=/path/to/install/python3/bin:$PATH``` and run python3 or pip3 anywhere you like.

## 5. Use pip to install module.
```
python3 -m pip install moduleName ## this is a more robust way.
pip3 install moduleName ## most of time this command is good enough.
```
